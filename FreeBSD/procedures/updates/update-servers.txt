Where $$VERSION is one of the RELENG below, if you want bleeding edge either omit -r or -rHEAD

HEAD

    Symbolic name for the main line, or FreeBSD-CURRENT. Also the default when no revision is specified.

    In CVSup, this tag is represented by a . (not punctuation, but a literal . character).

        Note: In CVS, this is the default when no revision tag is specified. It is usually not a good idea to checkout or update to CURRENT sources on a STABLE machine, unless that is your intent.
