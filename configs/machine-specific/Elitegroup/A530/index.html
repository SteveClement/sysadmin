<h3><center><b>IMPORTANT</b></center>
My disk was just crashed. I suspect overheating problem is the culprit. Situation was like this: 
The notebook was used to play several movies using mplayer, while sitting over my bed.
(Very bad move: no air flow below notebook). I think it was running overheated for around
one hour. (FYI, I live in a rather cool part of Indonesia, but not cool enough for PC; 
average temperature is around 20-28 C). <font color="ff0000">So, please activate your temperature monitor
and watch it closely.</font> I used to <b>force</b> my box run while its CPU temp around 65-85 C,
then reduce CPU frequency using <font color="7f00ff">longrun -s 0 33</font> if temp stays over 85.</h2>
<br><br>

I install Debian GNU/Linux Sid on it:<ul>
<li>kernel: <a href="kernel-image-2.4.22-ecs7_10.00.Custom_i386.deb">self-compile 2.4.22</a>, SiS patch: <a href="http://www.winischhofer.net/sis/sisfb_src_181003-1.tar.gz">sisfb_src_181003-1.tar.gz</a>; 
	<a href="config-2.4.22-ecs7">config-2.4.22-ecs7</a>; kernel 2.4.23 was tested, but <b>poweroff</b> failed to
	turn power off again despite of some tweaks I did which worked for 2.4.22; same problem with 2.4.24
<li>vga: xserver-xfree86 4.2.1-13, 
SiS patch: <a href="http://www.winischhofer.net/sis/sis_drv.o_4.2.1_gcc2_031103-1.tar.gz">sis_drv.o_4.2.1_gcc2_031103-1.tar.gz</a>; 
<a href="XF86Config-4-sis">XF86Config-4 (sis)</a>, <a href="XF86Config-4-vesa">XF86Config-4 (vesa)</a>
<li>ethernet: use <b>8139too</b> kernel module
<li>sound: use <b>trident</b> kernel module, but doesn't have proper volume support :(<br>
Brian Hinz gave me a must-try tip which will enable volume control:<br>
<i>However cmedia has drivers & source
code that work just fine available on their website:
http://www.cmedia.com.tw/driver/Linux/Ac97/cmaudio-041.tar.gz
The only other setting in your kernel config should be CONFIG_SOUND=y, the
rest of the sound modules should be left out.</i>
<li>wifi: <a href="ftp://ftp.linux-wlan.org/pub/linux-wlan-ng/linux-wlan-ng-0.2.1-pre14.tar.gz">linux-wlan-ng-0.2.1-pre14.tar.gz</a><br>
    then <b>hotplug</b> will enable WiFi properly
<li>acpi: thermal processor fan button ac <ul>
	<li>power button event detected and handled properly
	<li>lid switch event detected, but not handled correctly yet
	<li>processor support longrun feature, install <b>longrun</b> v0.9
	<li>processor throttle setting experiment: 8 throttle states, it works!<br>
	<b>echo -n 0..7 > /proc/acpi/processor/CPU1/throttling</b><br>
	... and watch its effect. I tested using <a href="http://www.distributed.net/">dnetc</a> client benchmark while running XMMS, when I set throtting level to 5 or more, xmms will starts to choke when dnetc benchmark is being run
	<li>processor limit setting experiment (I have to read docs about this later)<br>
	<b>echo -n X:Y > /proc/acpi/processor/CPU1/limit</b><br>
	... catting back that proc entry showed change in active limit and user limit, both changed to the same values
	as inputted, didn't test the real effect yet though ...
	</ul>
<li>usb: needs 3 kernel USB-host drivers: <b>ehci_hdc</b>, <b>usb-ohci</b>, and <b>usb-uhci</b>
<li>pointing device: works flawlessly, you can tap on touchpad to do click or double-click, but 
    of course you have to use the button to do a right-click :( ; only the 4-direction button 
    function not tested yet<br>
    Thorsten Becker gave me his tip regarding this:<br>
<i>You need the Synaptics Driver Maintained by Peter ?sterlund:
http://w1.894.telia.com/~u89404340/touchpad/index.html

I succeeded with Version 0.12.3 (actually the first Version I tried), followed the install-instructions and it worked. I only had to add the
+following configuration Section in the XF86Config-File:
<pre>
Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier  "Mouse0"
        Driver      "synaptics"
        Option      "Protocol" "auto-dev"
        Option        "RightEdge"     "5400"
        Option        "TopEdge"       "1900"
        Option        "BottomEdge"    "4000"
        Option        "FingerLow"     "25"
        Option        "FingerHigh"    "30"
        Option        "MaxTapTime"    "180"
        Option        "MaxTapMove"    "220"
        Option        "VertScrollDelta" "100"
        Option        "MinSpeed"      "0.02"

        Option        "AccelFactor" "0.0010"
        Option        "SHMConfig"     "on"
	Option      "ZAxis Mapping" "4 5 6 7"

<li>thermal sensor: needs i2c-source and lm-sensors-source packages; <b>sensors-detect</b> run told me to add <b>i2c-ali1535</b> and <b>adm1021</b> into /etc/modules,
    afterward <b>gkrellm</b> can be configured to show two new parameters: board temperature and CPU temperature!. BTW, those two source packages will put a .gz file in /usr/src.
    You need to tar xfz it, which will extract to /usr/src/module/pkgname. Then go to your kernel-source root directory, run <b>make-kpkg --rootcmd=fakeroot modules-image</b>
<li>poweroff: to be able to power off properly using kernel-2.4.22, I move <b>/sbin/poweroff</b> 
    to <b>/usr/local/sbin/poweroff</b> (it must keep its name, because it is a symlink to 
    <b>/sbin/halt</b>, and the application will run <b>halt -p</b> if it detects that 
    it was called via its symlink named <b>poweroff</b>), then create a script 
    <b>/sbin/poweroff</b>, which called <b>/etc/init.d/hotplug stop</b> before 
    <b>/usr/local/sbin/poweroff</b><br>
But another info from Brian Hinz hopefully help us:<br>
<i>When I moved to 2.4.23 the
power off feature broke, regardless of whether or not I included my own
dsdt, until I patched it with the 12032003 ACPI patch (it works fine under
2.4.23 now):
http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/lenb/acpi/patches/release/2.4.23/acpi-20031203-2.4.23.diff.bz2
</i>.
<li>modem: must test soon<br>
info from Windowx XP:<pre>
HSP56 MR (ALI+)
driver provider: PCtel
PCI ID: vendor 10b9, device 5457, subsystem 0f221019
AT+GMM: PCtel HSP Modem Data/Fax/Voice/Speakerphone/V.80
ATI1: A97/C2050
ATI3: PCtel HSP56 Modem 11.0341
ATI4: idem AT+GMM
ATI5: V.92</pre>
<!--
<ul>driver testing result:
	<li>pctel-0.9.6.tar.gz<br>
	you have to compile kernel using gcc-2.95 if you want to use pctel, because it contains some binary compiled using
	gcc 2, and refused to be modprobed later if you use kernel compiled using gcc 3.<br>
	<i>result:</i><br>
	failed
	<li>slmdm-2.7.14.tar.gz (latest official (supported) driver from <a href="http://www.smartlink.com/">SmartLink</a><br>
	this package generates slamrmo.o, slmdm.o (there are also slusb.o and slfax.o, but unused for my purpose); 
	device to use is /dev/ttySL0<br>
	<i>result:</i><br>
	driver loaded, but access to /dev/ttySL0 (via <b>pppconfig</b>, <b>minicom</b>) will hang up the machine on some point :(
	<li>slmodem-2.9.3.tar.gz (latest unofficial driver from SmartLink)<br>
	this package generates slamr.o (there is also slusb.o for USB modem, irrelevant to my ECS)<br>
	<i>result:</i><br>
	driver failed to load
</ul>
An A-530 owner told me that he tried to use slmodem driver, but failed with NO CARRIER message. 
He is luckier than me, because the best thing I got is machine lockup after apparent success
on loading driver.<p>
Seems that lspci and ATIn results above leads to nowhere. On the other hand, Googling
for FCC ID ECSM503BAM303W give no results also. Well, I tried to use board from my older
laptop (Compaq Presario 12XL205, Conexant winmodem, which was worked), also failed. Maybe
I need more time and patience.
-->
A very promising tip from Brian Hinz (again!):<br>
<i>The modem is fully functional if you use the version 2.7.10 of the SmartLink
driver AND make sure that you do not compile serial port support into your
kernel, either statically or as a module.  There is no serial port on this
machine but for some reason the serial port module will bind to the modem
and prevent it from working.  Versions of slmdm &gt; 2.7.10 do not seem to work
either. The driver can be downloaded at:
http://linmodems.technion.ac.il/packages/smartlink/slmdm-2.7.10.tar.gz</i>
<li>kernel 2.6.0-test9: USB mouse doesn't work, I will try to tweak kernel configuration
<li>special keys handling: use <b>xev</b> to get keycodes, 
    then run <b>hotkeys</b> to handle those keys. Here is xev <a href="keys.txt">result</a>.
    I configure some of those keys to run my favorite browser (Mozilla Firebird), and MUA
    (Mutt). Here is hotkeys <a href="ecs.def">specific configuration</a> and 
    <a href="hotkeys.conf">hotkeys.conf</a>. Note: brightness control keys, Fn+F7 for up 
    and Fn+F8 for down, are handled properly by BIOS(?) even when Linux is running, and <b>xev</b> 
    doesn't detect those events.
<li>Not ECS A-530 specific, but one of a few things I try first time using this cute box:<br>
    <ul>
    <li>Cablemodem connection: (a) Ethernet: simple, just setup dhcp client and make a proper
        configuration on /etc/network/interfaces. (b) USB: also simple, hotplug will detect
	a <b>CDCEther</b> compliant device, just add an <b>iface eth1 inet dhcp</b> line onto
	/etc/network/interfaces.
    <li>GPRS via USB/serial or USB/infrared adapter. Good & bad news. Using Mobile Action MA-620
    infrared to USB adapter, kernel panic on <b>irattach</b>. But using MA-8910P SonyEricsson to
    USB adapter, at last I can test GPRS on Linux successfully.
    </ul>
<li>Harddisk: install and configure <b>smartmontools</b>. Lesson learned from hard disk
    crash in office's server: activate S.M.A.R.T and related Linux daemon/utilities, 
    it will warn you in advance about hard disk problem. Hopefully you will be able 
    to do backup before real problem appears.
</ul>
<br><br>

Todo (unsorted):
<ul>
<li>try Brian Hinz tips on modem, need to recompile kernel
<li>test microphone, what application to record sound?
<li>screenshots? who needs screenshots? ;)
<li>try doing display toggle (LCD, LCD+external, external) from Fn+F12 using <b>hotkeys</b> and
	<a href="http://www.winischhoffer.net/linuxsisvga.shtml">sisctrl</a>
<li>lid switch event handling: how do you trigger a sleep? 
	<b>echo -n 1 > /proc/acpi/sleep</b> seems do, 
	but I don't know how to wake up :(
<li>find another wifi-equipped notebook, setup an ad-hoc network
<li>testing software suspend after doing full backup
<li>kernel 2.6.x
<li>Learn to write Linux driver for a USB webcam, maybe if I have spare time and gut ...
</ul>
<br><br>


Quirks:
<ul>
<li>no battery level interface, but battery has internal buzzer which will beeps when power is almost depleted
<li><b>Ins</b> key is on the left side of space bar, right beside <b>Alt</b>. I press the wrong key everytime :(
</ul>
<br><br>

Miscellaneous, updates:
<ul>
<li>Nov 11, 2003: Recompile kernel to support IrDA for handphone connectivity. Actually, I have two connection
                  options (due to hardware availability): IrDA or serial, both over USB. Then I will test
		  GPRS link using Sony Ericsson T310, Ericsson T39 or Siemens ME45.
<li>Nov 11, 2003: My link submission to <a href="http://tuxmobil.org/ecs.html">TuxMobil</a> was accepted.
<li>Nov 13, 2003: wmlongrun and gkrellm
<li>Nov 16, 2003: various ACPI aspects
<li>Dec 15, 2003: My link submission to <a href="http://www.linux-laptop.net/ecs.html">Linux on Laptops</a> was accepted.
<li>Dec 19, 2003: kernel 2.4.23
<li>Dec 22, 2003: modem testing, still failed :(
<li>Dec 27, 2003: special keys worked! thanks to Francois Galea
<li>Jan 15, 2004: wifi works!
<li>Feb 3, 2004:  several *very* positive feedbacks: sound, poweroff, modem, synaptics, thanks to Brian Hinz and Thorsten Becker.
