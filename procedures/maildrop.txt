Main issues:

if used with the native vpopmail maildrop patch, maildrop gets launched simply
as: maildrop

which means maildrop goes into: ~vpopmail

well no permissions on this directory:

chown vpopmail:vchkpw ~vpomail

ok, great, now you need a maildroprc

copy the one from ~vpopmail/maildrop/maildroprc.v2 /usr/local/etc/maildroprc

edit this file and add:

SHELL=/bin/sh

as the user vpopmail only has /nonexistent as shell
