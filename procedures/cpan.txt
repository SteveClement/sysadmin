CPAN
----

CPAN is the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network, a large & vaguely organised
collection of FTP archives containing Perl libraries and stuff.

It has a highly automated shell to help download things, known as cpan
(see perldoc CPAN).

1. Configuring CPAN shell

CPAN should put its build stuff in ~software/CPAN, not the default.
Cache size should be set to 100MB.

If you're behind a firewall, you may need to make FTP_PASSIVE true in the
environment. (You may also need FTP_PASSIVE_MODE=yes - sigh). Net::FTP
uses the former, and straight commandline ftp the latter (probably).
Net::FTP also has its own configuration which may get stored in lots of obscure
places. The most recent ftp clients use passive mode anyway.

You can fix this more permanently by answering as follows:

Where is your lynx program? [/usr/local/bin/lynx] /usr/bin/false
Where is your wget program? [/usr/local/bin/wget] /usr/local/bin/wget --passive 
Where is your ftp program? [/usr/bin/ftp] /usr/bin/pftp  

Set the dependencies to "ASK".

2. Downloading stuff

Run the cpan shell as root (cpan, or perl -m CPAN -s shell).
"i Goose" will tell you about the goose module, what version you have, and
what the latest version is on cpan. "install Goose" will download and install
it.

GOTCHAS
-------
If your CPAN mirror site is configured to something silly or broken, you can
change this by saying things like "o conf urllist" to view the list of
URLS, then "o conf urllist shift [new url]" to give it new URLs to try.
"o conf commit" will make changes permanent.

Be careful about the prerequisites_policy - if it is set to "follow",
CPAN will download & install *everything* it needs to make your requested
module work. This may include new versions of perl itself.

LOOK OUT FOR warnings about that cpan mirror being out of date.
