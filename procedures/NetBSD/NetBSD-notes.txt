To install NetBSD on a Newish laptop with USB2.0 Support if the install CD fails to boot you can:

Grab boot-tiny.fs and bang it on a Floppy.

Boot from it.
Install NetBSD.
Burn syssrc.tgz
Extract/Build/Install New Kernel. (Be carefull to take out all of the USB stuff)
As soon as the ehci drivers works you can compile it back in.
I haven't tested good old usb 1.1

This will work for my asus w5 and probably for some newer Dell's aswell.
NetBSD booted no problem on my sony vaio t2xp/t1xp (european model numbers)
