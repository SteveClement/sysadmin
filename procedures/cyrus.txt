NOTE:  Cyrus-imapd-2.0.16 no longer uses (x)inetd, so you have to put "/usr/cyrus/bin/master &" in rc.local.. Any entries for imap or pop3 in xinetd.conf will cause it to fail.

if you're going to do sasl client authentication (which you probably are), get the latest cyrus-sasl-1.x.x version, *NOT* cyrus-sasl-2.x.x like the docco implies! if you fail to do this, cyrus-imapd will fail to find the sasl libraries at compile time.

Cyrus imap.
===========

if you get:

  In file included from comparator.h:34,
                 from ./sieve.y:33:
  /usr/include/regex.h:46: syntax error before `regoff_t'
  /usr/include/regex.h:46: warning: data definition has no type or storage class
  /usr/include/regex.h:56: syntax error before `regoff_t'
  *** Error code 1

  Stop in /home/software/unpacked/cyrus-imapd-1.6.24-drac/sieve.
  *** Error code 1

when building cyrus-imap, apply the sieve.patch provided here.

or if you get:

### Making all in /home/software/unpacked/cyrus-imapd-1.6.24-drac/imap
gcc -L/usr/local/lib -R/usr/local/lib  -g -O2 -o collectnews collectnews.o libimap.a ../lib/libcyrus.a  -L/usr/local//lib -lsasl -lfl  -lutil  -lssl -lcrypto ../et/libcom_err.a
/usr/libexec/elf/ld: cannot open -lssl: No such file or directory
*** Error code 1

Stop.
*** Error code 1

Stop.

then add in front of your ./configure line this: LIBS=-L/usr/local/ssl/lib
so that you line looks like:
LIBS=-L/usr/local/ssl/lib ./configure --bla.....

this applies to version 1.6.24 of cyrus.

In RHlinux if you get:

imapd.c:58:21: com_err.h: No such file or directory
make[1]: *** [imapd.o] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/software/unpacked/cyrus-imapd-2.0.16/imap'

or:

timsieved.c:62:21: com_err.h: No such file or directory
make[1]: *** [timsieved.o] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/software/unpacked/cyrus-imapd-2.0.16/timsieved

add -I/usr/include/et to the CFLAGS line in the Makefile in the respective directory.

compiling on RH7.2 --with-auth=unix was needed during the configure.

Cyrus Drac support
==================

Ok, after loads of buggering about I actually firgured out how to compile it properly.
This is the line I used on mail and it worked, meaning it compiled allright with drac support:

CPPFLAGS=-DDRAC_AUTH LIBS=-L/usr/local/ssl/lib ./configure  --without-gssapi --with-openssl=/usr/local/ssl/ --without-krb --with-sasldir=/usr/local --with-dbdir=/usr/local/BerkeleyDB.3.2

now to check if the drac stuff really is compiled in you can do something scary like this:
in ~software/unpacked/cyrus-imapd-1.6.24-drac/imap

gdb -q imapd
on the gdb prompt type:
print dracdisc

dracdisc is a drac function which is only compiled in if DRAC_AUTH is defined, so if its not compiled in you get:
No symbol "dracdisc" in current context.


insert into /etc/pam.conf:

  # cyrus imap
  imap    auth    sufficient      pam_unix.so      try_first_pass

create an admin user:

  saslpasswd addyadmin

then make sure sasl db is readable by the daemons:

  root@lemon doc# ls -l /etc/sa*
  -rw-------  1 root  wheel  16384 Jul 10 16:49 /etc/sasldb.db
  root@lemon doc# chown cyrus:staff /etc/sasldb.db 
  root@lemon doc# chmod g+wr /etc/sasldb.db 

make sure user cyrus' primary group is "mail" in /etc/passwd.
add users you want to be able to admin cyrus to group "staff" in /etc/group

make sure daemon is in group mail in /etc/group:

  mail:*:6:daemon

put saslpasswd on local path:

  ln -s /usr/local/sbin/saslpasswd /usr/local/bin/saslpasswd

look at /etc/postfix/main.cf.default for lots of useful extras
and make sure at the very least you uncomment one of the "mydestination" 
lines in /etc/postfix/main.cf, and set myhostname and mydomain... e.g.

  myhostname = travelator.9feet.com
  mydomain = 9feet.com
  mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, $mydomain

and uncomment the line:

  mailbox_transport = cyrus 

since cyrus installs itself in /usr/cyrus, but postfix expects it to be in /cyrus, do:

  ln -s /usr/cyrus /cyrus

to allow mobile users to relay mail: http://www.yoyo.org/postfix/faq.html#mobile

to ssl wrap:

install stunnel.
create local cert/keypair in /usr/local/ssl/certs/stunnel.pem
make sure ownership & perms are correct:

  -r--r-----  1 root  mail   1921 Apr 26  2000 stunnel.pem

replace inetd with xinetd. put this in /etc/xinetd.conf:

# The defaults section sets some information for all services
defaults
{
        #The maximum number of requests a particular service may handle
        # at once.
        instances   = 250

        # The type of logging.  This logs to a file that is specified.
        # Another option is: SYSLOG syslog_facility [syslog_level]
        log_type    = FILE /var/log/servicelog

        # What to log when the connection succeeds.
        # PID logs the pid of the server processing the request.
        # HOST logs the remote host's ip address.
        # USERID logs the remote user (using RFC 1413)
        # EXIT logs the exit status of the server.
        # DURATION logs the duration of the session.
        log_on_success = HOST PID

        # What to log when the connection fails.  Same options as above
        log_on_failure = HOST RECORD

        # The maximum number of connections a specific IP address can
        # have to a specific service.  
        per_source  = 250
}

service imaps
{
        flags       = REUSE NAMEINARGS
        socket_type = stream
        protocol    = tcp
        wait        = no
        user        = cyrus
        server      = /usr/local/sbin/stunnel
        server_args = stunnel -r imap -p /usr/local/ssl/certs/stunnel.pem
}

you should have already done this as part of the imap install, but since it seems to get missed:

   cd /var/spool
   mkdir imap
   chown cyrus imap
   chgrp mail imap
   chmod 750 imap
   su -m cyrus
   ~software/unpacked/<cyrus>/tools/mkimap
   exit


and create /etc/imapd.conf, with something like:

  configdirectory: /var/imap
  partition-default: /var/imap
  admins: addyadmin benadmin honkadmin woodyadmin dougadmin paulgadmin
  sasl_pwcheck_method: sasldb

and /etc/cyrus.conf, with:

  # standard standalone server implementation

  START {
    # do not delete these entries!
    mboxlist      cmd="ctl_mboxlist -r"
    deliver       cmd="ctl_deliver -r"

    # this is only necessary if using idled for IMAP IDLE
    #  idled                cmd="idled"
  }

  # UNIX sockets start with a slash and are put into /var/imap/socket
  SERVICES {
    # add or remove based on preferences
    imap         cmd="imapd" listen="localhost:imap" prefork=1
  #  imap          cmd="imapd" listen="imap" prefork=0
  #  imaps         cmd="imapd -s" listen="imaps" prefork=0
  #  pop3          cmd="pop3d" listen="pop3" prefork=0
  #  pop3s         cmd="pop3d -s" listen="pop3s" prefork=0
  #  sieve         cmd="timsieved" listen="sieve" prefork=0

    # at least one LMTP is required for delivery
  #  lmtp         cmd="lmtpd" listen="lmtp" prefork=0
    lmtpunix      cmd="lmtpd" listen="/var/imap/socket/lmtp" prefork=0
  }

  EVENTS {
    # this is required
    checkpoint    cmd="ctl_mboxlist -c" period=30

    # this is only necessary if using duplicate delivery suppression
  #  delprune      cmd="ctl_deliver -E 3" period=1440
  }

make sure things get started at startup - add to /etc/rc.local

  echo starting xinetd
  /usr/local/sbin/xinetd

  echo starting cyrus imap
  /usr/cyrus/bin/master &

you may also need to add an alias in /etc/profile to overcome a weird perl/library problem:

  alias cyradm='LD_PRELOAD=/usr/local/lib/libsasl.so cyradm'

Compile Errors
--------------

If your getting strange compile errors try compiling without gssapi which is a Kerberos thing...

blow config.cache away first...

./configure --without-gssapi

I was getting a compile error like this:-

   In file included from IMAP.xs:51:
   ../../lib/imclient.h:56: sasl.h: No such file or directory
   *** Error code 1

So, try using these options:-

./configure --with-dbdir=/usr/local/BerkeleyDB.3.3 --with-sasldir=/usr/local

you may have to change the '--with-dbdir=' option depending on your version of BerkeleyDB, but '--with-sasl=/usr/local' is the important bit, cos if it can't find sasl, it will die during 'make'

Creating users (i.e. mailboxes)
-------------------------------

First:

saslpasswd2 <new user name>

add a password for the user, then:

cyradm -user <admin user> <host>

Note that if you do -user=fred instead of -user fred, then you get a
very obscure error:

application-specific initialization failed: unknown host

At the prompt:

hostname> cm user.<new user name>

Err, that's it.

Deleting mailboxes
------------------

Useful when you screwed up!

At the cyradm prompt (see above):

hostname> sam <mailbox> <admin user> all
hostname> dm <mailbox>

Clearing the deliver databases
------------------------------

In root's crontab (or /etc/periodic/daily?) run this daily, to clear
the delivery database, which otherwise grows forever:

su cyrus -s /bin/bash -c '/usr/cyrus/bin/deliver -E 3

<NOTE: NOT YET CONFIRMED TO WORK - DELETE THIS LINE WHEN IT IS>
