How to hack gesallw in SQL mode:
--------------------------------

First off the gesall Database runs on Adaptive Server Anywhere (ASA)
some cool tools are in: C:\Program Files\ASA(VERSION_NUM)

but the tool we want: dbisql.exe 

in the window that appears u/p: dba/sql

now you could select you database from the browser tab but just launch Gesallw to use the on that you USE.

And tada youve now got admin rights on the DB to get a listing of the table/columns Edit->Insert Table...
