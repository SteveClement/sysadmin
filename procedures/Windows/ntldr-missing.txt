----- Created september 6th 2004
Location: Garage Roger&Diego - problem appeared after september 2nd 2004 blackout (PC not shut down properly)

A Windows XP doesn't boot up anymore, right after BIOS recap it says

"NTLDR fehlt. Ctrl+Alt+Del zum Neustarten"


After googling I found a M$ Article: 318728

One of the following files are probably missing or corrupted:
- ntldr
- ntdetect.com
- boot.ini
all located in the root directory of the windows installation (C:\)


Solution:
- Boot Windows in Recovery Console Mode using an Installation CD-ROM
- Copy the missing files (in the 1st case it was just ntldr and ntdetect.com) from a working computer to a floppy disk
- Copy content of floppy disk into root directory (C:\)

Reboot, and done

May want to do a scandisk just to be sure.



Note:
According to M$ the BIOS may be out of date when having this problem, but I consider that a rather improbable problem.
