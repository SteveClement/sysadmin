Adobe Photoshop 7.0 Weirdnessess...

Ok some notes on how to salvage stuff:

If on 7.0 Make sure you upgrade to 7.0.1

If pallettes dissapear from the screen and all else fails (Pallette reset and
so on)

Click on whatever makes the pallette (or dialog box) appear and press:
Alt-Space

Select move and the Cursor should jump to the location where it is situated
but you can still see it now just navigate with the CURSOR KEYS so that the
window reappears.

Another option, (untested though), there is a safe-mode/recovery-mode in
Photoshop, but I can^t remember the Key-Combo during startup...
