To get WinCVS talking to putty you need to do the following:

Create maybe a batch file so this stuff gets included by default in WinCVS

set CVS_RSH="\Program Files\putty\plink.exe"
set PLINK_PROTOCOL=ssh
"c:\Program Files\GNU\WinCvs 1.2\wincvs.exe"

Now create a session in Putty to your CVS "Server"
We'll call it: ioncvs

now in WinCVS go:

Admin->Preferences
In general enter CVSROOT:
:ext:ioncvs:/home/cvs
Authentication:
SSH Server

-> Ports
Alternate rsh name:
C:\Program Files\putty\plink.exe
Click OK

Admin->Command line
cvs co MYREPOOOO

DONE!
