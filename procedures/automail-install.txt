This explains a fresh Automail install on a server with FreeBSD 6.2-Release, Perl 5.8.8

Short:
pw groupadd automail
mkdir /home/automail
cd !$

tar xfvz /path/to/automail.tar.gz
mkdir store
chown -R bla:bla *
p5-FreezeThaw (FreezeThaw.pm)
p5-DB_File-Lock (DB_File::Lock.pm)
p5-MIME-Tools (MIME/Entity.pm)
p5-Time-modules (Time/ParseDate.pm)
p5-IO-stringy (IO::Scalar)

That was the short version, the crucial bit is the chown, here you need to
make sure that the automail process can write to it's files, in my case it is:
alias:qmail
Also the store directory needs to be accessible to the sysadmins that are
going to work on templating automail.

Now once that is done you need to create the corresponding entry in the .qmail
or .forward file for the email address/user that is going to process
automails, in my case: /var/qmail/alias/.qmail-rootmails should contain:

| /home/automail/run_automail-debug

That script looks like this:
#!/bin/sh

PERL5LIB=/home/automail/automail/perl
export PERL5LIB
FLAGS=""
/home/automail/automail/perl/automail.pl --nofatal
/home/automail/automail/conf/automail.conf > /tmp/am.trace.$$ 2>&1

if [ $? -gt 0 ]
  then
   mv /tmp/am.trace.$$ /tmp/am.fail.$$
    elif [ ! -s /tmp/am.trace.$$ ]; then
     rm /tmp/am.trace.$$
fi
# for now...
exit 0
EOF

Other configs to do:

/homa/automail/automail/conf

contains some (or rather ONE main) conf file.
take a look at automail.conf and tweak it accordingly, I have the strong
suspicion that not all is used in that file.

Debug:
/tmp/am.*
There you will find all the logs about automail and they are really helpful.


Thats the server side covered, over to the client side:

cd /home/steve/work/my-wild-repo/
mkdir automail
tar xfvz /path/to/the/very/same/tarball/automail.tar.gz
cd automail
vi grab.pl
Tweak the necessary host entries
vi Makefile
Tweak the necessary host entries
commit all the files to your repo.
Read automail.txt for usage.

grab.pl modify

Automail add-ons:

Lots, and lots, you could make this thing really cool with some spare coder
time... One main thing that bothers me is the fact that you cant selectively
tell it to accept mails from a certain host. That is nowadays with all the
crap and spam a necessity. Even if you obfuscate the automail e-mail address.

Biach...

If you up your system to perl 5.8 it breaks automail horribly...
but luckily we can do:

vi /home/automail/automail/perl/automail.pl

first line: !#/usr/bin/perl

If you upped it properly that points to /usr/local/bin/perl
just replace it with: !#/usr/bin/perl5.00503 

and it will work again...
