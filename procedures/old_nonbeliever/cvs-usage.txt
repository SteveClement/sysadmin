For all GUI People there is a rather good Linux CVS Client called lincvs that
seems functional.

To add a directory to CVS you don't need to commit.
 mkdir mynewdir
 cvs add mynewdir
and it's in.

To add a new file to CVS you 1. Create the file 2. Add the file 3. Commit the file.

 vi cvs-usage.txt
  [BLA bla bLa]
 cvs add cvs-usage.txt
 cvs commit
add your description for this commit and done.

To remove stuff from the Repo you need to (re)move it first from your local tree otherwise you'll get:
cvs remove: file `cvs-usage.txt' still in working directory
cvs remove: 1 file exists; remove it first

So do what the man says :)

ATTENTION CLASS:
================

If you want to copy a directory for templating purposes make sure you either dont copy the CVS directories or REMOVE them afterwards otherwise you end up with one big fucking mess...
