Latest zlib: 1.1.4

# ION procedure for upgrading to OpenSSH 3.6 or later.

#### ALL OF THE ABOVE IS SUBJECT TO CHANGES, CAUSE IF YOU  UPGRADE THIS WAY YOU END UP WITH INSTALLS IN /usr and /usr/local if PORTS installed.####

For manual upgrades you should have 2 windows open on the box you are upgrading. 1 should be logged in as root. Leave it logged in until the procedure is finished.

*************************************
*                                   *
* First install zlib 1.1.4 or later. *
*                                   *
*************************************

Unpack OpenSSH-3.6.1p2 (the latest & greatest at the time of writing) or 3.1 or later.
Configure it with 

./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc/ssh

If it complains about OpenSSL you need to install the latest OpenSSL or 0.9.6d or later.

Install in the usual way.

make
rootdo make install

Become root, or use the other window (already logged in as root).

Copy the configuration files from their new home in the repository (suppose-aldigital-sysadmin/ssh-configs) to /etc/ssh/

Change the lines that load sshd in/etc/rc.local to 

/usr/sbin/sshd -f /etc/ssh/sshd_config
/usr/sbin/sshd -f /etc/ssh/sshd_config.localhost

(note that the new ssh user binaries are in /usr/bin/)

Both windows should now be logged in as root. 
Kill the parent sshd task for the main sshd, not the root shim.
         ------
Restart sshd by copying and pasting from /etc/rc.local.

On another machine remove the line(s) pertaining to the target machine and ssh to it to test that all is working.

You should still have 2 windows logged in as root. kill the root shim parent sshd, copy/paste your line from rc.local to run it again.

You will get a message saying Version 2 protocol not enabled. That's
because we have left out the hostdsakey line in the root shim config
which would stop the root shim from working.  But sshd will start up OK.

ssh to root from another window to test it.

Disable all the binaries and configs for the old ssh, either by renaming (or deleting) them. If renamed I feel the executable flag should be removed for the binaries as well. Comments? They are

All the ssh files in /etc/ but not /etc/ssh/ !	 Maybe these should be	 moved to /etc/old-ssh_configs/ ?

/usr/local/sbin/sshd*
/usr/local/bin/ssh*
/usr/local/bin/scp

I test it once more by logging out and in again, including to root. If it all works you are done. If it doesn't you still have a window logged in as root to fix it :)
