To set up openvpn the ion way in gentoo:

Kernel conf:
Network Device Support:
-> Universal TUN/TAP Driver

either ass module (tun.o) or compiled in, as you wish.
echo tun >> /etc/modules.autoload.d/kernel-2.4

all files must reside in /etc/openvpn/*/

where * is a "config name" like ion-vpn

/etc/openvpn/ion-vpn/
-> certs
-> bin
local.conf

local.conf is the usual openvpn.conf

don't forget to check if tun.o is loaded automatically...
also /dev/net/tun must exist
the route command is different on Linux:

route add -net $NET netmask $MASK gw $GW

Thats all folks :)
