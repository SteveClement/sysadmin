How to build a Software-RAID with vinum under FreeBSD:

Add to /etc/rc.conf:

start_vinum="YES"

reboot.

If you have virgin disks which are to be completely used for vinum,
then do this, otherwise partition as appropriate:

Use /stand/sysinstall (note: there may be ways that are better/more
obvious to sysadmins than this, if so please inform me! Ben):

Configure
Fdisk

for each disk in the RAID, select it and do a "Use Entire Disk" and
"Write Changes" ignoring the dire warning (I found it was impossible
to partition the disk without doing this first).

then get back to the command line.

For each disk, do:

disklabel -e <diskname>

and add a partition (I used "e") with the same parameters as "c" only
the fstype is vinum, e.g.:

  c: 156296322        0    unused        0     0        # (Cyl.    0 - 9728*)
  e: 156296322        0     vinum                       # (Cyl.    0 - 9728*)

then create a /etc/vinum.conf as appropriate - for RAID 0:

# Drives
drive d1 device /dev/ad1e
drive d2 device /dev/ad2e
drive d3 device /dev/ad3e
# Volumes
volume raid
 plex org striped 300k
  sd length 0 drive d1
  sd length 0 drive d2
  sd length 0 drive d3

Some features to note: "length 0" means use the lot. "striped 300k"
means each stripe is 300k long - this should not be a power of two,
because then the superblocks all end up on one disk. "volume raid"
determines the name of the device created (in this case
/dev/vinum/raid).

Note that this file is NOT used except once when initialising, but its
a good idea to keep it in case of problems.

Then create it:

root@liberty:~# vinum create /etc/vinum.conf 
3 drives:
D d1                    State: up       Device /dev/ad1e        Avail: 0/76316 MB (0%)
D d2                    State: up       Device /dev/ad2e        Avail: 0/76316 MB (0%)
D d3                    State: up       Device /dev/ad3e        Avail: 0/76316 MB (0%)

1 volumes:
V raid                  State: up       Plexes:       1 Size:        223 GB

1 plexes:
P raid.p0             S State: up       Subdisks:     3 Size:        223 GB

3 subdisks:
S raid.p0.s0            State: up       PO:        0  B Size:         74 GB
S raid.p0.s1            State: up       PO:      300 kB Size:         74 GB
S raid.p0.s2            State: up       PO:      600 kB Size:         74 GB

if you screw up the config or disks, then this will fail, and its
somewhat hard to get vinum to recover. The best way I found was to do:

vinum resetconfig
vinum stop
vinum start

BUT NEVER DO THIS UNLESS YOU ARE READY TO LOSE EVERYTHING!

then do a newfs on the new disk:

newfs -v /dev/vinum/raid

(-v is required coz the disk is NOT partitioned).

create a mount point:

mkdir /raid
mount /dev/vinum/raid /raid

add it to /etc/fstab:

/dev/vinum/raid         /raid           ufs     rw              2       2

for example.

Reboot to check it comes back.
