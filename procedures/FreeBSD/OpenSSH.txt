This document is intended to describe the updating of:
OpenSSH and OpenSSL on FreeBSD.

To start of with let me explain the 3 Different ways of installing Open-SSH/SSL:

 - You can install the packages from ports and keep them up to date with portupgrade for instance.
 - You can download and build it manually with your custumized options.
 - You can CVS up your source tree and build it there.

The recommended way of doing it is the latter because BY DEFAULT we have it installed that way on a fresh FreeBSD box, so thats why I am ONLY explaining that way to be sure everyone uses it.

If you haven't CVS checked out your source yet do it now! If you need help with FreeBSD CVS Tags read the FreeBSD-CVS-Tags.txt file in this repo.

Step 1, MOVING the old source out of the way

 root@jserver:/usr# mv src src-

Step 2, Setting CVSROOT to your fastest mirror and logging in

 root@jserver:/usr# export CVSROOT=:pserver:anoncvs@anoncvs.de.freebsd.org:/home/ncvs
 root@jserver:/usr# cvs login
 Logging in to :pserver:anoncvs@anoncvs.de.freebsd.org:2401/home/ncvs
 CVS password: 
 cvs login: warning: failed to open /root/.cvspass for reading: No such file or directory

#You can ignore the error, the .cvspass file should have been created by now, if not, touch it.

Step 3, Checkout the Version you want with the specific tag

root@jserver:/usr# cvs co -rRELENG_5_0 src

#Go grab a coffe if your on a slow line, its gonna take a while.

Step 4, go into the source tree and diff your old Kernel Config with the new GENERIC one and merge eventual needs. (FreeBSD-kernel.txt for instructions of standards and other issues)

root@jserver:/usr# cd src/sys/i386/conf && mv /usr/src-/sys/i386/conf/JSERVER .
root@jserver conf# diff -u JSERVER GENERIC |more

Step 5, build a new kernel and reboot

root@jserver conf# cd /usr/src && make buildkernel KERNCONF=JSERVER && make installkernel KERNCONF=JSERVER

Step 6, build a new world for your FreeBSD and install it. (Carefull with updates e.g: 4.x -> 5.x)
