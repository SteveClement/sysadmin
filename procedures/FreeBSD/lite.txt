== Lite install of FreeBSD v6.2 ==

This is based on a FreeBSD User Install and a VMWARE Image.

pkg_add -r will be used for packages.

Binary installs will be prefered over source installs.

Only the bare minimum will be installed to keep the machine as clean as possible.

configure your machine:

sysinstall

Configure -> User Management
		-> Group . Add a group according to your username
		-> User . Configure the username to use, include yourself in wheel to su to root afterwards
 -> Console
	-> Keymap configure your keymap (Swiss French IsoAccent)
 -> Time Zone . Configure your timezone
 -> Networking 
	-> Interfaces (configure your Network interface)

In vmware if the network interface doe not work disable it and re-enable it by simply clicking on it twice, but slowly...
Also make sure the Interface is in bridged mode

Once installed run as root:

freebsd-update fetch install
