freebsd netmasks are slightly weird when installing ip aliases.
The example in /etc/defaults/rc.conf doesn't tell the whole story:

  ifconfig_lo0_alias0="inet 127.0.0.254 netmask 0xffffffff" # Sample alias entry.

this is correct because it's being bound to an interface that already has a valid netmask for it's network,
and is on the same network. it wouldn't be if it was introducing a brand new network.

here is a better example:

  ifconfig_xl0="inet 213.129.65.44 netmask 0xffffe000"
  ifconfig_xl0_alias0="inet 213.129.65.71 netmask 0xffffffff alias"
  ifconfig_xl0_alias1="inet 193.115.128.4 netmask 0xffffff00 alias"
  ifconfig_xl0_alias2="inet 193.115.128.5 netmask 0xffffffff alias"
  ifconfig_xl0_alias3="inet 193.115.128.6 netmask 0xffffffff alias"

alias0 has all 'ff' for it's netmask as it's on the same network and interface as 213.129.65.44, which already has a valid
netmask. however, alias1 needs to specify a new netmask as it's the first one on that network. 2 & 3 go back to all 'ff' again.
