Hi Ports people,

[Some search terms I used: +CONTENTS Missing , broken /var/db/pkg , +CONTENTS
recovery , +CONTENTS gone , FreeBSD Ports /var/db/pkg/ recovery ]

I had a rather nasty awakening while upgrading Xorg 7.2 which was not due to
Xorg 7.2 but rather to a waiter that was too slow to bring me the Bill (food
was good though) and my inability to reach a power outlet in time.

In the following mail I will shortly explain what I did and what happened.


What Happened?

 While portupgrade'ing -a my battery died


Consequence?

 All my /var/db/pkg/*/+CONTENTS files were gone!
 And my /usr partition was damaged (fsck -f /usr fixed that in Single user mode)


Why +CONTENTS vanished?

 This is a very good question that I have not answered yet, I can only say
 that I did what /usr/ports/UPDATING suggested, upgrade to portupgrade-devel
 portupgrade -a and of we go.
 If someone knows why, let me know.


What now?

 So I thought I could recover them but after some Searching I think that's not
 that easy for some obvious reasons, so I had to go the rough route of
 reinstalling all the ports.

 I did try various portsdb -Fu, pkgdb -F etc but to no avail.


 Important note:

 READ THE ENTIRE DOCUMENT FIRST, BEFORE ROCKING IN AND TYPING COMMANDS AWAY.

 TAKE A BACKUP OF ALL YOUR PRECIOUS CUSTOM MADE CONFIGS AND REMEMBER THAT WE
 ARE GOING TO REINSTALL EVERY PORT EVER INSTALLED TO THE CURRENT VERSION!


Procedure:

 As the +CONTENTS files were gone pkg_info told me for every installed package the following error:

   pkg_info: the package info for package 'spca5xx-20060402_2' is corrupt

 So at least I know what is broken and with a bit of stderr redirecting we can fix it.


Now all I did is filter out the broken ports:

cd /tmp
pkg_info 2> pkg.err
cat pkg.err |cut -f 2 -d\' |cut -f 1 -d\- |sort |uniq > pkg.reinstall


 pkg.reinstall now contains the "base name" of the ports, as I needed a quick
 fix package with names like xorg-name-version I did not take into account as
 I can always do them by hand afterwards.

 Let's force reinstall the packages:

export FORCE_PKG_REGISTER=yes

for a in `cat pkg.reinstall` ; do
 portinstall -i $a
done


 The -i is the safety switch here. Bare in mind that -i does not care about
 dependencies and will only install them without prompting (is there a way to
 include deps in interactive mode?)
 As /var/db/pkg is broken it will pull in every dependency off every port we
 install in alphabetical order.


Speeding things up:

 To speed the reinstall up you might want to take a look at your ports and if
 you have enough experience and "know" thy dependencies you can simply
 portinstall $COMMON_PORTS and leave it run.
 Also a pkgdb -F will pull in some dependencies and install them for you.
 This will be more unattended that the beginning with a portinstall -i


Monitoring Progress:

cd /tmp
while [ true ]; do
 pkg_info 2> pkg.err.list > /dev/null
 wc -l pkg.err.list
 sleep 5
done

 As I installed over my ports this number diminished "steadily" :) and some
 idea of when I will be done is always nice.


Other Issues:

 I did have to intervene manually from time to time.
 Some packages have: ln -s source dest where destination exists the install failed
 So I had to remove the destination file and make install again to make it go
 through, this was especially true for some lib* ports.

 Don't forget your custom config files.

 Another issue I had is that some ports where updated so I ended up with stale
 directories but pkg_delete -f $PORT did the job to remove them from my db.

 Maybe a problem now is that I probably have some nasty left-overs from
 old versions of the installed ports as I only installed over the existing port.
 If your installed ports were VERY old (3-6months) this is even more an issue,
 as mine was only out for a couple of weeks it was fine, allthough a ports
 freeze in between I wasn't too concerned about the updated ports.


Other options?

 Yes, I could have reinstalled the machine but that is nowadays no option under
 any decent OS, hell even my Windows reinstalls have become rarer :)

 Another option would have been to copy the +CONTENTS files from an early
 backup, but no backup :)

 Or perhaps copying +CONTENTS from a similar machine with the same ports
 installed, I tried that for a few ports but Checksums were wrong etc, etc so
 I gave up, and with 300 ports installed the script needed for this would have
 been tedious...


The end?

 Well folks I hope this comes in handy to other people and if someone has a
 better idea that would've saved me ~150 lines of email and hours of
 recompiling my ports, be my guest we want to know...



cheers,

Steve Clement
