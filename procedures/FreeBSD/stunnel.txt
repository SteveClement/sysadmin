To get stunnel under FreeBSD going:

portinstall stunnel

Default opts. ar OK.

stunnel is a "pseudo" client server model, I wanted to SSL-Wrap  3 services:

pop3 qmqpd smtp

on my mail server I had the following stunnel.conf:


; Certificate/key is needed in server mode and optional in client mode
cert = /usr/local/etc/stunnel/stunnel.pem
;key = /usr/local/etc/stunnel/mail.pem

; Some security enhancements for UNIX systems - comment them out on Win32
chroot = /var/tmp/stunnel/
setuid = stunnel
setgid = stunnel
; PID is created inside chroot jail
pid = /stunnel.pid

; Some performance tunings
socket = l:TCP_NODELAY=1
socket = r:TCP_NODELAY=1
;compression = rle

; Some debugging stuff useful for troubleshooting
;debug = 7
;output = stunnel.log

foreground = yes

; Service-level configuration

[pop3s]
accept  = 995
connect = 110

[ssmtp]
accept  = 465
connect = 25

[628]
accept  = 495
connect = 628




I had to: 
	mkdir -p /var/tmp/stunnel /var/log/stunnel /usr/local/stunnel/supervise/stunnel/log
	chown stunnel:stunnel /var/log/stunnel /var/tmp/stunnel

I decided to use daemontools to supervise the tunnel because under a chroot
the standard FreeBSD scripts are a pain in the bum.

vi /usr/local/stunnel/supervise/stunnel/run
#!/bin/sh
exec 2>&1
exec /usr/local/sbin/stunnel /usr/local/etc/stunnel/stunnel.conf

vi /usr/local/stunnel/supervise/stunnel/log/run
#!/bin/sh
exec /usr/local/bin/multilog t s100000 n20 /var/log/stunnel

chmod 550 /usr/local/stunnel/supervise/stunnel/run /usr/local/stunnel/supervise/stunnel/log/run


cd /var/service && ln -s /usr/local/stunnel/supervise/stunnel stunnel


on the "client" side for qmqp(s)d:
; Some security enhancements for UNIX systems - comment them out on Win32
chroot = /usr/local/var/stunnel/
setuid = stunnel
setgid = stunnel
; PID is created inside chroot jail
pid = /stunnel.pid

; Some performance tunings
socket = l:TCP_NODELAY=1
socket = r:TCP_NODELAY=1
;compression = rle

; Some debugging stuff useful for troubleshooting
;debug = 7
;output = stunnel.log

foreground = yes

; Use it for client mode
client = yes

[495]
accept =  628
connect = linion.ion.lu:495


vi /usr/local/stunnel/supervise/stunnel/run
#!/bin/sh
exec 2>&1
exec /usr/local/sbin/stunnel /usr/local/etc/stunnel/qmqpsd.conf

vi /usr/local/stunnel/supervise/stunnel/log/run
#!/bin/sh
exec /usr/local/bin/multilog t s100000 n20 /var/log/stunnel

chmod 550 /usr/local/stunnel/supervise/stunnel/run /usr/local/stunnel/supervise/stunnel/log/run

cd /var/service && ln -s /usr/local/stunnel/supervise/stunnel stunnel
