== Tips and Tricks worth knowing ==


= MBR Issues =

If other operating systems have damaged your Master Boot Record, you can
reinstall it either with /stand/sysinstall or with boot0cfg(8). See
"man boot0cfg" for details.

An example:

 split -b 1440k file.tar.gz file_
 cat file_* > newfile.tar.gz 


= Duplicate ports check =

If you want to quickly check for duplicate package/port installations,
try the following pkg_info command.

	pkg_info | sort | sed -e 's/-[0-9].*$//' | \
		uniq -c | grep -v '^[[:space:]]*1'

= Ports history =

CVS is the answer:

 cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@anoncvs.at.freebsd.org:/home/ncvs login
 CVS password: anoncvs
 cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@anoncvs.at.freebsd.org:/home/ncvs co -D "5 months 3 weeks ago" imake-4


= cd - =

A more general bash/unix tip imagine this:

cd /usr/ports/somewhere/long/and/painfull

Even with tab completion it's a pain, once there, you notice that you HAVE TO
do somethind somewhere else:

cd /somewhere
ls
rm
diff
ls
<NOW TO GET BACK TO THE LAST DIR YOU CD'ED INTO>
cd -
will get you right back where you left, it's a sort of "back-button" for chdir's


= sed =

Want to use sed(1) to edit a file in place?  Well, to replace every 'e' with
an 'o', in a file named 'foo', you can do:

	sed -i.bak s/e/o/g foo

	And you'll get a backup of the original in a file named 'foo.bak', but
	if you
	want no backup:

		sed -i '' s/e/o/g foo
		steve@lapplion steve $ 


= mkcert =

locate mkcert

will yield a nice little helper to create a test certificate dig around it and
brew your own...


= ISO Image Mount =

Mounting an iso or a raw image:

    mdconfig -a -t vnode -f /path/to/image.iso -u 1
    mount -t cd9660 /dev/md1 /mnt/cdrom

To reverse the process:

    mount -u /mnt/cdrom
    mdconfig -d -u 1


= Turning off Keyboard Beep =

Any user can do that for his current login.
Especially hand when working in a VMWARE or similar circumstance.

kbdcontrol -b off
