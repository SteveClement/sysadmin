On FreeBSD 4.3 and later you need to follow "Procedure 2. Building a kernel the ``new'' way" from http://www2.ua.freebsd.org/handbook/kernelconfig-building.html if the source tree has changed at all.

Well, this is true but the old style kernel build is still valid e.g:

cd /usr/src/sys/i386/conf/
config KERNELCONFIGHOSTNAME
cd ../../compile/KERNELCONFIGHOSTNAME
make depend && make && make install

Make sure your config is up-to-date and in Sync.
If you pulled or updated the CVS tree for the kernel you better compile config first otherwise weird core dumps haunt you:

cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/config
make && make install

This is indeed easier and the new way:

cd /usr/src
make buildkernel KERNCONF=TOBERMORY
make installkernel KERNCONF=TOBERMORY

In FreeBSD 4.2 and older you must replace KERNCONF= with KERNEL=.
