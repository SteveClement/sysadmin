MANUAL INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
==============================

To complete the installation of print/cups-samba, do in order:

CUPS-BASE
-----------

1) Uncomment application/octet-stream line in mime.types
2) Uncomment application/octet-stream line in mime.convs
3) Restart cupsd

SAMBA
-------

1) edit the [global] section of smb.conf and make sure it has these
   lines (see 'man cupsaddsmb' for more info):

[global]
	load printers = yes
	printing = cups
	printcap name = cups

2) edit the [printers] section of smb.conf and make sure it has these
   lines:

[printers]
	comment = All Printers
	path = /var/spool/samba
	browseable = no
	public = yes
	guest ok = yes
	writable = no
	printable = yes
	printer admin = root

3) edit the [print$] section of smb.conf and make sure it has these
   lines:

[print$]
	comment = Printer Drivers
	path = /usr/local/share/cups/drivers
	browseable = yes
	# guest ok = yes works too
	guest ok = no
	read only = yes
	write list = root

4) restart Samba

____________
NOTE:  Samba needs to know about the passwords for printer admin and
write list or authentication will fail.


CUPS-LPR
----------

1) Run cupsaddsmb

If only a subset of your printers will be installed as exportable to
MS Windows NT/XP/2000/2003 clients:

#cupsaddsmb -U root cups_printer_1 cups_printer_2 ...

To export all printers to MS Windows NT/XP/2000/2003 clients:

#cupsaddsmb -U root -a

In either case, you will be prompted for the root password.

WINDOWS
---------

1) Browse and install for a network printer as usual.  The drivers
will be automagically installed.

____________
NOTE:  Other settings in smb.conf may work, but your REALLY need to
know what your are doing.  :)

/usr/local/share/doc/samba/Samba-HOWTO-Collection.pdf has some
valuable information on this topic, especially chapters 17 and 18.

   browsable = no






Remark: The "netbios name" in the smb.conf must be the same then the hostname
of your server.

workgroup = MYWORKGROUP specifies the Windows domain that the Windows
workstations use.

logon drive = H: is the drive letter under which the SAMBA share will appear
in the Windows Explorer.

With logon script = scripts/logon.bat you can specify a Windows batch script
that is executed as soon as a Windows workstation logs in. If the script does
not exist, you can comment out that line.

Create the directories for domain logons and profiles:

mkdir /home/samba
mkdir /home/samba/netlogon
mkdir /home/samba/profiles
mkdir /var/spool/samba
chmod 777 /var/spool/samba/
chown -R root:users /home/samba/
chmod -R 771 /home/samba/

Now we restart Samba:

/etc/init.d/samba restart

Edit /etc/nsswitch.conf. Change the line:

hosts: files dns

to:

hosts: files wins dns

Add all computers of your workgroup in the /etc/hosts file on the server.

192.168.0.100 server1
192.168.0.110 workstation1
192.168.0.111 workstation2
192.168.0.112 workstation3
192.168.0.113 workstation4

Add the root user to the SAMBA password database. The root user (alias:
Administrator) will be our domain administrator. This account is needed to add
new computers to the SAMBA domain.

smbpasswd -a root

Create the file /etc/samba/smbusers and add the line by executing:

echo "root = Administrator" > /etc/samba/smbusers

This will allow us to use the common windows username "Administrator" as alias
for the Linux root user.

Now I will test if the setup is correct:

smbclient -L localhost -U%

The output should look similar to this:


Domain=[MYWORKGROUP] OS=[Unix] Server=[Samba 3.0.14a-Ubuntu]

        Sharename       Type      Comment
        ---------       ----      -------
        netlogon        Disk      Network Logon Service
        print$          Disk      Printer Drivers
        IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (server1 server (Samba, Ubuntu))

        Workgroup            Master

        MDKGROUP             IPRG
        MYWORKGROUP          SERVER1


Setup the default domain groups for windows:

net groupmap modify ntgroup="Domain Admins" unixgroup=root
net groupmap modify ntgroup="Domain Users" unixgroup=users
net groupmap modify ntgroup="Domain Guests" unixgroup=nogroup

Adding Users To Our SAMBA Domain

Now we will add a user, e.g. tom, to our Samba domain. You will have to add a
user like this for each user account you want to connect to this SAMBA domain
server.

1) Add a linux user tom:

useradd tom -m -G users

2) Add the linux user tom to the SAMBA password database:

smbpasswd -a tom


Adding Shares

Now I will add a share that is accessible by all users.

mkdir -p /home/shares/allusers
chown -R root:users /home/shares/allusers/
chmod -R ug+rwx,o+rx-w /home/shares/allusers/

At the end of the file /etc/samba/smb.conf add the following lines:

[allusers]
  comment = All Users
  path = /home/shares/allusers
  valid users = @users
  force group = users 
  create mask = 0660
  directory mask = 0771
  writable = yes

Now we restart Samba:
/etc/init.d/samba restart


Installing CUPS

If you want your SAMBA server to act as a print server also, you have to
install and configure CUPS: 

To get access to the web interface from my workstation, I will change cups to
listen on the Server IP.
Edit /etc/cups/cupsd.conf in the section Network Options:

Listen 127.0.0.1:631
Listen 192.168.0.100:631

Set AuthGroupName to shadow in the section Security Options:

AuthGroupName shadow

To allow access only from my admin workstation (IP: 192.168.0.70), I add Allow
From 192.168.0.70 the security options and set AuthClass to Group:

<Location /admin>
#
# You definitely will want to limit access to the administration functions.
# The default configuration requires a local connection from a user who
# is a member of the system group to do any admin tasks.  You can change
# the group name using the SystemGroup directive.
#

AuthType Basic
AuthClass Group

## Restrict access to local domain
Order Deny,Allow
Deny From All
Allow From 127.0.0.1
Allow From 192.168.0.70

#Encryption Required
</Location>

Add the cupsys user to the shadow group:

adduser cupsys shadow

and restart the cups daemon:

/etc/init.d/cupsys restart

The cups webinterface is now accessible with any webbrowser from my
workstation:

http://192.168.0.100:631/

Now I can login to the cups interface with username root and my root password.

Hint: If there is no linux driver available for your printer and you want to
use this printer only from your windows workstations trough SAMBA, you can use
the printer manufacturer RAW and install the correct driver on your windows
workstation.

If you created a new printer in cups, you will have to add it to samba with
the command:

cupsaddsmb -a

Have fun!
