How to add a manpath under FreeBSD.
-----------------------------------

If you want to add a manpath which is not in the usual place add an appropriate entry to: /etc/manpath.config
such an entry could look like:

MANDATORY_MANPATH       /home/apache/man

in /etc/manpath.config you can also do PATH to MANPATH mappings and add MANLOCALES...
