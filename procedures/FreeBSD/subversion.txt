This guide is a full subevrsion Install with Apache Support and DAV Support,
on workstations this is NOT needed!


= Full Subersion Install =

echo "devel/subversion: WITH_MOD_DAV_SVN|WITH_APACHE2_APR" >> /usr/local/etc/ports.conf
echo "devel/apr-svn: APR_UTIL_WITH_BERKELEY_DB=yes" >> /usr/local/etc/ports.conf
cd /usr/ports/devel/apr-svn && make install clean
cd /usr/ports/devel/subversion && make install clean

You should build `www/apache22' with db4 support to use subversion with it.
Please rebuild `www/apache22' with option `WITH_BERKELEYDB=(db4|db41|db42)'
and try again.

Or you can disable db4 support. Only 'fs' repository backend will be
available.
To disable db4 support, define WITHOUT_BDB.

echo "devel/subversion: WITHOUT_MOD_DAV_SVN|WITHOUT_APACHE2_APR" >> /usr/local/etc/ports.conf


= Client only install =

echo "devel/subversion: WITHOUT_NEON|WITHOUT_MOD_DAV_SVN|WITHOUT_APACHE2_APR" >> /usr/local/etc/ports.conf
echo "devel/apr-svn: APR_UTIL_WITH_BERKELEY_DB=yes" >> /usr/local/etc/ports.conf
cd /usr/ports/devel/apr-svn && make install clean
cd /usr/ports/devel/subversion && make install clean
