# Things to check before deploying new iron.

1. Physical:

	a. All components seated correctly, and secured correctly.
	b. All fans working, with no bearing problems, or airflow.
	c. General check - (like reset button prob. on bb boxes)
	d. Check if there is an PCI Raiser for future easy upgrade.
	
2. Power:

	a. Check that the machine powers on again after an outage.
	b. All power connectors are firm.
	c. See 5. BIOS, n.b.

3. CRT & kbd:
	(give up now if your machine is a sparc)

	a. Check that the crt is still enabled if the machine is
	   booted without a monitor.
	b. Check the machine will boot without a keyboard.
	c. Check that the keyboard is still enabled if the machine is
	   booted without a keyboard.

4. Nic:
	
	a. The network card must do full-duplex. 
	b. Auto-negotiation is not an option.

5. Bios

	a. Disable Chipaway virus detect (if present)
	b. Other bios features may need tweekin:
		- cas latancy time (as advised on boot)
		- ide auto detect off.
		- APM Power Managment
	c. Enable the USB Keyboard support option (if present)
	   in case a PS/2 port breaks we can still use USB

n.b. -	with old style broadberry boxes, the reset switch is prone
	to jamming. make such the power failure setting in bios is
	set to "on" rather than "last state". really this should be
	the case anyway, but last-state is usually ok - just not
	with these particular cases.
