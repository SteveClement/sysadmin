This procedure tells me the steps needed to hand a website off from a
development server.


First off all we need to known if anything has changed in the httpd.conf file,
e.g: rewrites/restrictions/auths/davs...

Then we need to make sure that everything is checked into the repository.
If all is committed ssh to target machine.
cvs up the Website tree
backup copy the old website tree (beware off excludes_has to live in repo)
