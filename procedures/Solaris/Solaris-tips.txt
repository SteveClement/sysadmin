A few useful things on solaris:

To boot a solaris install cdrom into single user mode after something went horribly wrong do this on the go prompt:

boot cdrom -s

where cdrom is the device and -s the single usermode switch.

To copy a partition layout, or do other funky dangerous stuff to your solaris box you can use the utility "fmthard" it is rather self explaining.

If you want to restore a partition table or similar use the utility called prtvtoc.
