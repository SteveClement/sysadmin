Automail lives in the suppose-aldigital-tools repo. So check it out NOW!

How to template machines?
-------------------------

Fairly easy, you need to know the hostname of the box and the "kind"
of mail your getting for instance we have george.inv.thebunker.net's
security output this would be the template: george.security. So you go
into suppose-aldigital-tools/automail and say:

./grab.pl george.security

If you get:

ls: /home/automail/store/2001.07.31/*george*security*: No such file or
directory

The mail is probably dated earlier than todays date, then you need to
use the --offset switch: ./grab --offset=5 georger.security That puts
you 5 days into the past, just take the newest dated mail output and
adjust "offset" accordingly.

Finally if you've found the right template you get asked: Copy
/home/automail/store/2001.07.26/george.inv.thebunker.net-2001.07.26.01.00.59-george.inv.thebunker.net_security_check_output
to templates/george.security?

Say y here, then it tries to open the editor with whatever is in the EDITOR
variable. Now you need to put a star as the first character of the first line - this is because some mailers recognise
lines in this format as breaks between mails. Do the appropriate
changes in the different sections to sensible values and save the
file. Commit your changes back to the repo and hand it off by typing
"make" in the top directory.

Do those steps for all mail outputs to be templated - only if automail
says "missing template", of course. Usually the function of a mail
output is highlighted in the mail subject line. And according to that
the templates in the repo. are named e.g: Daily output, <host>.daily |
Backup output, <host>.backup Take a look in templates to see wots wot.

Note that if you tell grab to get x.y, then it looks for a file called
*x*y. Amazingly, this is almost always right!

Also, if the file subject is not one automail automatically recognizes
(all it knows about are daily, weekly, monthly and security mails),
then you must specify the type of mail by adding headers. See below
for options.

Next read on how to do a handoff.

How to adjust templates?
------------------------

Very easy again, you go into
suppose-aldigital-tools/automail/templates/ , and edit the mail
outputs file e.g: <host>.<mail_output_function> Add or remove the
different parts you want to template and save the file commit it back
in, and hand it off.

Mandatory: insert an asterix at the start of the From: line, generally
the first line of the mail, viz:

From: root@foo.thebunker.net
	becomes
*From: root@foo.thebunker.net

(no whitespace between asterix and From)

How to handoff Automails?
-------------------------

Is the easiest of all, go to suppose-aldigital-tools/automail and
type: make Make sure that you have commited all your changes back to
the repo. and that you have access to male...


Automail Headers
----------------

These headers can be added to the end of the mail headers to tell
automail how to process the mail.

X-Automail-Type: <type>
-----------------------

<type> is one of:

monolith		expect the mail to look exactly the same

monolith-pattern	compare the mail line-by-line using regular
			expressions

monolith-backup		expect a backup mail (note that comparison is
			still using regular expressions)

monolith-pattern-optional
			expect each line in the mail to be matched by
			a line in the template

Every non-standard mail must have a type.

X-Automail-Frequency: <frequency>
---------------------------------

<frequency> is one of:

daily
weekly
monthly
random

Every non-standard mail MUST have a frequency.

X-Automail-Backup-Days-Off: <day list>
--------------------------------------

<day list> is a space separated list of days (three letter versions)
that the backup is expected to fail on.
