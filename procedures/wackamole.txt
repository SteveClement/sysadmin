Installing wackamole
--------------------

Wackamole can be found at www.backhand.org.

First install spread.

Allocate a fixed IP address to each machine (for safety), and also a
variable (i.e. wackamole administered) one. It is easier if the
variable range is contiguous. If it is not, wackamole currently needs
a patch (should be in patches) to allow multiple "of" fields.

Then create a /etc/wackamole.conf looking like this (see the one in the
distribution for more comments):

# this machines "standard" variable address - if the machine is up, it
# will always have at least this address.
vip 213.129.65.179

#The "of" field gives a range of virtual addresses which are to be managed by
#wackamole. Note that each address must be a range even if it is a
#single address
of 213.129.65.177-177
of 213.129.65.179-179
of 213.129.65.181-181

#The "router" field gived the ip address of the router
#router router_ip. This is not used under FreeBSD AFAICS.
router 213.129.64.254

#This field is the broadcast address for the virtual addresses to be
#managed. Required because ifconfig requires it. Not sure it has any
#material affect - unless, of course, you use broadcast for something!
bcast 213.129.95.255

#This field is the network mask for the virtual addresses to be
#managed. I set it to all 1s coz that's what we normally do for secondaries.
netmask 255.255.255.255

#This field is the interface on which wackamole ups and downs virtual addresses.
interface fxp0

#This field is the maximum number of IP addresses that will move from one 
#wackamole to another during a round of balancing. Leave it as it is.
balance rate 1

#This field gives the time (in seconds) between rounds of
#balancing. Leave it as it is.
balance timer seconds 5

#This is the time between the first wackamole's initialization and the
#maturity process.  During this interval, IPs are not managed. Leave
#it as it is.
maturity timeout seconds 5

#If this is set to 0, balancing takes place as normal.  Otherwise, 
#there is only one round of balancing per membership event, and all
#IPs are balanced at once. Leave it as it is.
Complete Balance 1

Then add:

/usr/local/sbin/wackamole -c /etc/wackamole.conf

to /etc/rc.local.

Note that this will cause ARP whinging on other hosts, as the
addresses move between machines.
