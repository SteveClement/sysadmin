Installing postgres on a fresh system:

Create a postgres user account on the box your installing postgress on, this is the account which will be used later to run and administer postgres, I'll take postgres to make it easy...

./configure --with-perl

that option builds the perl interface and plperl extension language

gmake

rootdo gmake install

cd doc

rootdo gmake install


Put this in your rc.conf:

ldconfig_paths="/usr/lib/compat /usr/X11R6/lib /usr/local/lib /usr/local/pgsql/lib"

Then reboot...

After the reboot do as root:

mkdir /usr/local/pgsql/data
chown postgres /usr/local/pgsql/data
su -m postgres
/usr/local/pgsql/bin/initdb -D /usr/local/pgsql/data


     The -D option specifies the location where the data will be stored. You
     can use any path you want, it does not have to be under the
     installation directory. Just make sure that the superuser account can
     write to the directory (or create it, if it doesn't already exist)
     before starting initdb. (If you have already been doing the
     installation up to now as the PostgreSQL superuser, you may have to log
     in as root temporarily to create the data directory underneath a
     root-owned directory.)

add postgres to /etc/rc.local to start it automagically at boot:

echo Starting Postgres SQL
nohup su -m postgres /usr/local/bin/start_postgress &

where start_postgress is this shell script:

#!/bin/sh
# Written by Ben to avoid having to figure out how to escape all the redirection!

exec /usr/local/pgsql/bin/postmaster -D /usr/local/pgsql/data >> /var/log/postgresql.log 2>&1


be carefull in what order you start the different services otherwise something requests a Dbase serever and its not started yet...

also add those directories to your PATH and MANPATH respectively:
PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/pgsql/bin
MANPATH=$MANPATH:/usr/local/pgsql/man
export PATH MANPATH
