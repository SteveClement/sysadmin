Scripts used to migrate mail from spack.lxcdm.lu to bonnie.lxcdm.lu, mail-trans.sh: 

(NOTE: everythin is to be performed in your home directory, you don't have to be root but a working mail environment is needed, this is the final step of an mail migration)

for a in `cat username.txt`; do
echo "echo \"poll spack.lxcdm.lu protocol POP3 user $a" >> fetch1.txt
done

for a in `cat password.txt`; do
echo " password $a" >> fetch2.txt
done

for a in `cat email.txt`; do
echo " smtpname $a smtphost bonnie.lxcdm.lu verbose \" > .fetchmailrc " >> fetch3.txt
echo " ; chmod 600 .fetchmailrc ; fetchmail " > fetch4.txt
done

lam fetch1.txt fetch2.txt fetch3.txt fetch4.txt > fetch.sh

Explanation:

the following 3 files were created by dissecting mail-trans.txt:
info@cspetange.lu,cspetange-info,PASSWORD
comite@cspetange.lu,cspetange-comite,PASSWORD
info@grengmiersch.lu,grengmiersch-info,PASSWORD

username.txt had all the remote host (spack) usernames in it.
The first for loop created the first part of the fetchmailrc script

password.txt had all the remote host passwords NOTE: both username.txt and password.txt were 'IN-SYNC'
The second for loop created the second part of the fetchmailrc script

email.txt had all the remote host e-mail addresses to be migrated. AGAIN: they were in sync
The third for loop did the rest of the jobs, it finished the fetchmail line and added the actual fetchmail statement.

lam (laminate) does what you think it does, *fetch.txt laminated together to fetch.sh

~/.fetchmailrc (file that gets called upon starting fetchmail without arguments)

snipplet from fetch.sh 3lines:

echo "poll spack.lxcom.lu protocol POP3 user cspetange-info password PASSWORD smtpname info@cspetange.lu smtphost bonnie.lxcdm.lu verbose " > .fetchmailrc ; chmod 600 .fetchmailrc ; fetchmail 
echo "poll spack.lxcom.lu protocol POP3 user cspetange-comite password PASSWD smtpname comite@cspetange.lu smtphost bonnie.lxcdm.lu verbose " > .fetchmailrc ; chmod 600 .fetchmailrc ; fetchmail 
echo "poll spack.lxcom.lu protocol POP3 user grengmiersch-info password PASSWORD smtpname info@grengmiersch.lu smtphost bonnie.lxcdm.lu verbose " > .fetchmailrc  ; chmod 600 .fetchmailrc ; fetchmail 

what is fetchmail, from man fetchmail:

DESCRIPTION
       fetchmail  is  a mail-retrieval and forwarding utility; it fetches mail
       from  remote  mailservers  and  forwards  it  to  your  local  (client)
       machine's  delivery  system.   You  can  then handle the retrieved mail
       using normal mail user agents such as mutt(1), elm(1) or Mail(1).   The
       fetchmail utility can be run in a daemon mode to repeatedly poll one or
       more systems at a specified interval.



This script could've been done quicker and more elegantly, but this worked for
me and was nicely broken down into steps of 3.
