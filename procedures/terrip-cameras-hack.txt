In the ZI Contern they installed weird crappy cams that are wireless, to ertrieve their admin passwords do thiz:

telnet IP_CAM
User: user
NOPASSWORD :)

cd /etc/

and in there you will find the main config file with the plaintext password in it, I couldnt figure out how to permanently remove the user account.
