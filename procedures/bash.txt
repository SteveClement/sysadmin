jaja da quirks:

This is because the for loop is using $IFS to determine what the field
separators are. By default $IFS is set to the space character, which is
why you are getting the above results. IFS needs to be set to the
end-of-line character for your for loop to work.

Try something like this :

ORIGIFS=$IFS
IFS=`echo -en "\n\b"`

# insert for loop here

IFS=$ORIGIFS
