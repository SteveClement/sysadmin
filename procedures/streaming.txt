Streaming is a wonderful thing but some things to bare in mind:

Bandwidth, to see how much your stream chews install the google desktop bar
and the additional system info tools. It will give you kb/s output.

On my LinVDR setup streaming a DVB channel peaked at 700kb/s and average at
500kb/s. That's probably due to the fact that I get the stream pretty RAW.

Obviously in Luxembourg your upstream is pretty piss poor 192kb/s so you would
need to downsample the stream to something that consumes your entire upstream
and bounce it off some big pipe.

I tested this working with a VLC (videolan.org) setup:

UDP-Dwnsampled a stream to one of our windows servers in the Datacenter and
re-streamed it to the web, that was working OK.
