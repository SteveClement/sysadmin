Warning.
=======

if mail is sent to the server with a first letter for which there is no
database, postfix gives an error about being unable to open the db file,
despite bouncing the mail.

Plain old Postfix install
-------------------------

Unpack postfix. As you:

  make

As root:

Create a postfix user, no login directory, no shell.
Create a postdrop group.

  mv /usr/sbin/sendmail /usr/sbin/sendmail.OFF
  mv /usr/bin/newaliases /usr/bin/newaliases.OFF
  mv /usr/bin/mailq /usr/bin/mailq.OFF

Restart sendmail with -q15m (or whatever) if machine has a mail queue.
Stop it otherwise.

  cd ~software/unpacked/postfix-...
  make install

Accept the defaults for all questions.

Sort out potential aliases confusion (N.B. this assumes that
/etc/aliases is a softlink to /etc/mail/aliases, and the latter is a
real file - be careful if that's not true):

  ln -s /etc/mail/aliases /etc/aliases
  ln -s /etc/mail/aliases.db /etc/aliases.db
  ln -sf /etc/mail/aliases /etc/postfix/aliases
  ln -sf /etc/mail/aliases.db /etc/postfix/aliases.db

  newaliases

Edit /etc/postfix/main.cf as appropriate.

Edit /etc/rc.conf:

sendmail_enable="NO"

Edit /etc/rc.local:

/usr/sbin/postfix start

Then run:

  /usr/sbin/postfix start

Test that incoming/outgoing mail work.


Update periodics
----------------

Automail can't handle the blank lines in Postfix' mailq output, so
modify the daily script (/etc/periodic/daily/440.status-mailq on the
machine I looked at) to say:

    mailq | sed '/^$/d'

instead of:

    mailq

(i.e. strip blank lines).

installing with berkeley db & DRAC (see also cyrus procedures file)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

you would want to do this if you want to allow roaming users to use the postfix
smtp server as their outgoing mail gateway.

first, get & install latest berkely db (http://www.sleepycat.com)
make sure you build it with 185-api compatibility:

   cd build_unix
   ../dist/configure --enable-compat185 
   make
   make install

then, in postfix source directory do:

  make tidy
  # you may need to tweak the following paths for your version of db.
  make makefiles CCARGS="-DHAS_DB -DPATH_DB_H='<db_185.h>' -I/usr/local/BerkeleyDB.3.2/include" AUXLIBS=/usr/local/BerkeleyDB.3.2/lib/libdb.a 
  # you will get lots of "redefinition" warnings during the make - ignore them!
  make
  postfix stop
  sh ./INSTALL.sh
  # now recreate the alias & virtual databases with berkeley 3.x or postfix will fail to start
  (make sure that all three possible locations for aliases and aliases.db are all pointing at the same files.
   the possible locations are: /etc /etc/mail and /etc/postfix. use softlinks to point them all to one of those
   three. i use /etc/mail).

(do what it says above, in the vanilla install instructions, for soft linking alias files)

  newaliases
  postmap /etc/postfix/virtual

make sure /etc/postfix/main.cf has some sensible defaults. in particular, 'mynetworks' should contain at least the machines local ip(/32) and 127.0.0.1/32 or it won't be able to send out mail itself.

  postfix start

aliases and virtuals
--------------------

since postfix (or rather cyrus) doesn't support dots in user names, we must rewrite them...

postfix supports both local aliases and "virtual" domains. aliases will rewrite any name to a local user. 
e.g.

  m.macura:	mmacura

will rewrite "m.macura@<whatever.com>" to "mmacura@<whatever.com>", where <whatever.com> is the primary local
domain.

alternatively, virtual domains allow you to receive multiple domains on the same server, but each address has to 
be specifically translated into a local user. this results in a nice little gotcha...

  m.macura@balkanholidays.co.uk   mmacura
  @balkanholidays.co.uk		  catchall@some.other.domain.com

what happens here is that "m.macura@balkanholidays.co.uk" gets re-written to "mmacura@balkanholidays.co.uk", but
since there is no explicit entry for "mmacura@balkanholidays.co.uk" it gets caught by the fallback address and
forwarded to "catchall@some.other.domain.com". the correct way to handle this is:


  m.macura@balkanholidays.co.uk   mmacura
  mmacura@balkanholidays.co.uk    mmacura
  @balkanholidays.co.uk		  catchall@some.other.domain.com


install DRAC
------------

get source from  http://mail.cc.umanitoba.ca/drac/

edit Makefile and replace tunable section with (for FreeBSD):

  INSTALL = install
  EBIN = /usr/local/sbin
  MAN = /usr/local/man/man
  DEFS = -DSOCK_RPC -DFLOCK_LOCK -DGETHOST -DDASH_C -DREQ_HASH
  CC = cc
  RANLIB = ranlib
  CFLAGS = $(DEFS) -g -I/usr/local/BerkeleyDB.3.2/include/
  LDLIBS = -L/usr/local/BerkeleyDB.3.2/lib -ldb
  TSTLIBS = -L. -ldrac
  RPCGENFLAGS = -I -C
  MANLIB = 3
  MANADM = 8

then do:

  make
  make install

put this in /etc/rc.local:

  echo starting DRACD for smtp
  /usr/local/sbin/rpc.dracd

you will also need to switch on portmap for dracd.

once running, DRAC will create a database in /etc/mail/dracd.db. you can dump 
it with db_dump which was installed as part of berkeley db:

  db_dump -p /etc/mail/dracd.db

which should produce something like:

  VERSION=3
  format=print
  type=hash
  HEADER=END
  DATA=END

'type=hash' is important - this is what postfix needs. 

edit /etc/postfix/main.cf and add:

  # allow DRAC controlled relaying
  smtpd_recipient_restrictions = permit_mynetworks, check_client_access hash:/etc/mail/dracd, check_relay_domains

restart postix:

  postfix reload

test that unauthorised relaying is still denied by pointing your outgoing smtp gateway at the server. sending 
a mail should get you a reject. tail /var/log/maillog and find the ip address that was rejected. now add yourself
to the drac authentication database:

  cd ~software/unpacked/drac-1.11
  ./testing localhost <IP address> 
  db_dump -p /etc/mail/dracd.db

you should see something like:

  VERSION=3
  format=print
  type=hash
  h_nelem=1
  HEADER=END
   <IP address>
   981204512
  DATA=END

send the mail again. this time it should go through.

you're done.
