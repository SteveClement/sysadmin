# getting going with ircservices

overview:
  ircservices provides stuff like nick reservation, channel control
  and auto-op'ing of nicks.

  you interact with them by talking to various pseudo users, eg:
  /msg NickServ identify <password>

  for extended interaction it's often easier to use a dialog, eg:
  /dialog NickServ
    help
    set email foo@them.org

   all the *Serv's will give you help if you ask for it

privilege:
  ircservices has a super-user, a set of admins, and a set of operators
  (in order of descending godness)
  admins can make ircservices restart, shutdown etc, whilst operators can
  do more day-to-day actions like kicking users, tweaking channel modes etc

  within a managed channel there's also a heirarchy of channel operators
  which is completely separate from the serverwide stuff (see below)

initial - setting up the superuser:
  logon to irc with the nick you've put in ServicesRoot
  become irc operator (more debug, access to ChanServ)
  using NickServ, reserve the supernick you're using (root):

    /oper lemon <ircpassword>
    /nick root
    /dialog NickServ
      register <superpassword> sysadmin@aldigital.co.uk

  and then identify yourself:
      identify <superpassword>

  and set the su password the same (allowing admins to become superuser):
    /msg OperServ set supass <superpassword>

initial - setting up an admin:
    /nick lemon
    /dialog NickServ
      register <password> lemon@aldigital.co.uk
      identify <password>

    /msg OperServ su <superpassword>
    /dialog OperServ
      admin add lemon
      oper add lemon

reserving a channel:
  this allows you to then do stuff like auto-op nicks and enforce modes etc
    /nick lemon
    /join #citrus
    /dialog ChanServ
      register #citrus <chanpassword> all things citrus, and more
      info #citrus
      set #citrus entrymsg you have arrived in the grove

sorting out auto-op on a channel (as the nick that created it):
  there are three lists associated with a channel:
  super-ops (SOP), auto-ops (AOP), voice-ops (VOP)
  a SOP nick can administer the AOP list; AOPs can add VOPs.
  all nicks must be registered with NickServ

    /dialog ChanServ
      identify #citrus <chanpassword>
      sop #citrus add lemon 
      aop #citrus add zestboy 

everything else:
  most of the help is informative, especially ChanServ's. just /msg the
  appropriate *Serv with 'help'.
  remember to speak to ChanServ you must be an irc op.
