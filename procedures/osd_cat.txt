osd_cat is neat, but handling X fonts is not!

the directory to look out for:

/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts

in there some files are important, just to give you an example how you specify
a font on the command-line to osd_cat:

-misc-fixed-medium-o-semicondensed--13-120-75-75-c-60-iso8859-1

yeah right, easy :)

so what does it mean, it means that this you wont find on the disk but in one
of the files in the beforementioned directory.

Some fonts include special characters:

 -b&h-luxi mono-bold-r-normal--0-0-0-0-m-0-iso8859-1


Use quotes:

-f "-b&h-luxi mono-bold-r-normal--0-0-0-0-m-0-iso8859-1"

Some fonts have aliases, which makes it easier to predict output:

lucidasanstypewriter-24

is an alias for

-b&h-lucidatypewriter-medium-r-normal-sans-34-240-100-100-m-200-iso8859-1


this is in the file

fonts.alias

the long format is in fonts.dir
