Stupid trash can trick under unix:

put the shell script: trash into your path
echo $PATH

mkdir ~/.trash
vi ~/bin/trash
#!/bin/sh
mv $@ ~/.trash/

alias rm=trash

to use the original rm command:
\rm ~/.trash/*

This can be fine tuned off course, by adding compression/versioning and all
kinds of funk to the trash shell script
