Google-Hilite...

1. Save 'google_hilite.php' somewhere on your server.

2. Add a style to your CSS:

        .hilite { background-color: #FF9; }
        
(By all means change the colour, but the class must be called .hilite)

3. Place this at the top of your pages or template:

        <?php 
        $dr = $_SERVER[DOCUMENT_ROOT];
        include_once($dr.'/PATH/TO/google_hilite.php');
        ob_start("google_hilite"); 
        ?>

Place the following wherever you'd like to welcome the google visitor:

        <? google_welcome(); ?>

Hit google with sumfink you know your site's gonna be in the top 10...

See the results...

This can obviously be pushed further if you have more than one keyword you
want to hilite.
