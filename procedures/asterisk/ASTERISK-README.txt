These are some example configs for my Asterisk server at home, which doubles as my home office.  You can find asterisk at http://www.asterisk.org/

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at jtodd@loligo.com or on the IRC channel #asterisk where I can often be found.

Thus far over 700 people have downloaded my examples!  I've also had many downloads of the sounds that I've made available.  I'm pleased to see that Mark has included my monkeys in the standard distribution, plus some of the other prompts that Allison Smith (http://www.theivrvoice.com/) recorded for me that I've forwarded.

These examples are almost completely untouched from my working configuration, with the exceptions of my disguising some of the account numbers and (obviously) all of the passwords with bogus data.  Where possible, I have left numerics and alphanumerics in some similar format so as to be obvious to the reader when numerics are required for passwords.

These examples will serve to illustrate a few more features and perhaps different ways of doing things than what is included in the Asterisk examples.  These examples are far from complete; my goal was not to utilize all the features of Asterisk (though I did use quite a few.)  You will still need to read the "documentation" that comes with Asterisk to get it running in it's basic form, and you will need to heavily cannibalize the examples that I provide.  In the future I plan to put a "bare bones" configuration sample up, because my home system is becoming a fairly complex and not-easy-to-understand call flow, despite my excessive commenting of the examples.conf file.

I have quite a few other servers running at this point other than my home server, but this is the installation I feel most comfortable giving out in "whole" format, where some of my clients may not wish to have their configurations in such detail presented to the outside world.  If you have questions on more advanced configs, feel free to send them - at the worst, I'll put some thought into perhaps a new issue that I've not encountered before and I'll be unable to answer your question. At best, I'll have a pre-existing small snippet or example that I can send you.

Additionally, if anyone needs consulting help with Asterisk on a level that requires more than simple off-the-cuff answers, I am available for such work.  I'm portable, as well, so those of you overseas can also use my services, especially if you are in tropical locales.  ;-)  I have installed several professionally implemented Asterisk systems at this point, and I'm focusing much of my time on the platform.
