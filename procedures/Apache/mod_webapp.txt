How to build mod_webapp, tested with Apache 1.3.22+SSL 1.45 and
ebapp-module-1.0.1-tc401.

Building Apache
---------------

First, Apache has to be built and installed for this to work at all,
as far as I (Ben) can tell. Corrections welcome!

If Apache is 1.3.23 or earlier, apply the patch
suppose-aldigital-sysadmin/patches/apxs.pl.patch to apxs.pl:

cd ~software/unpacked/apache-1.3.22/src/support
patch < .../apxs.pl.patch

in ~software/unpacked/apache-1.3.22 (after SSL applied):

./configure --enable-shared=cern_meta

cern_meta is a module chosen that a) isn't enabled, b) we don't
use. This is simply to get sharing enabled, which mod_webapp requires.

Then install (required to get a usable version of apxs):

rootdo make install

Building mod_webapp
-------------------

In /home/software/unpacked/webapp-module-1.0.1-tc401:

./configure --with-apxs=/usr/local/apache/bin/apxs

(for this is where apxs will land by default). Then:

make
