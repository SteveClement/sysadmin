Get the tarball from http://www.webdav.org/mod_dav/mod_dav-1.0.2-1.3.6.tar.gz 
Extra resources can be found at http://www.webdav.org/

Configure mod_dav with apache build directory and make etc...

	./configure --with-apache=/home/software/unpacked/apache_1.3.14
	make
	make install

cd to apache build directory, re-config and remake apache...

	./configure --activate-module=src/modules/dav/libdav.a --with-layout=Apache
	make

Copy the apache binary into /~apache/bin

	cp ~software/unpacked/apache_1.3.14/src/httpsd ~apache/bin/

Move the images directory (or whatever is going to be DAV'ed) outside the DocumentRoot or it will be overwritten by the next handoff..

Edit httpsd.conf and add some extra info...

Set the location of the DAV lockfile..
DAVLockDB /home/apache/logs/artesian.inv.thebunker.net/DAV/DAVLock

Create Aliases for the DAV and Images directories..
Alias /DAV_images /home/apache/hosts/www.ianallan.com.images
Alias /images /home/apache/hosts/www.ianallan.com.images

The DAV directory is going to be htpasswd'ed, so you'll need to add the info below...

<Location /DAV_images>
                DAV On
                AllowOverride none
                Options -ExecCGI
                AuthUserFile /home/apache/auth/DAVaccess
                AuthType Basic
                AuthName "Images"
                require valid-user
</Location>

The DAV'ed directory, needs to be owned by whatever apache runs as (prolly webserv), or you need to run a seperate instance of apache configured purely
for DAV access that runs as a dummy user that has group write to the web tree. 
this is a better option if you want to use DAV as your main upload facility.
