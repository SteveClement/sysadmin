be warned... if you get an error about alloc.h, you need to edit:

  ~software/unpacked/apache_1.3.14/src/modules/auth_mysql/Makefile

and change the reference to ap_alloc.h

and if you can find the new home page for this project, please let us know! currently you need to grab it from a 
machine that already has it (like signpost). also note there is an MD5 patch if you want to add MD5 as a crypto 
method. this is required if you are going to share authentication database with PTS, for example.
