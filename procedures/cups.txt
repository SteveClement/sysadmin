If cups-lpr command line printing fails, then the cups client conf misses the
server name of the cups server.

cups recently updated to a much cooler version 1.2 unfourtenatly hell broke
lose during the update...

so we have to deinstall cups and then reinstall and reconfigure it, careful as
a PDF printer is installed too..

cups-pstroaster and cups-samba are installed as dependencies so probably they
are the base problem...
