Suspend to RAM / Suspend to disk

Suspend to RAM works fine with kernel 2.6.11 - first enter in the file
/boot/grub/menu.lst the line
# kopt=root=/dev/hda7 ro resume=/dev/hda6 ro root=/dev/hda7 ro
# resume=/dev/hda6vga=normal acpi_sleep=s3_bios
where in my case hda7 is the partition with the root-directory and hda6 is the
partition with the swap partition (see in your file /etc/fstab).
Now, as user=root just enter the command:
echo mem >/sys/power/state
In order to wake-up the machine, press the power-button (now blinking every
couple of seconds in orange color). The button will then light in green color
and after about 1 minute and 43 seconds the machine will be up again -
including the network!
Now I could speed-up things: Having entered the following in the file
/etc/X11/XF86Config-4:

Section "Device"
        Identifier      "Generic Video Card"
        Driver          "i810"
#next line for suspend-to-RAM working properly:
        Option          "VBERestore"    "true"
EndSection

With this, the laptop now resumes operation after about 40 seconds! Well, it
works most of the time, but not always... And: Be prepared, that the
system-load will be very high during the first few seconds after the resume...
