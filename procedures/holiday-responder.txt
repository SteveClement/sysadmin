to set up a message for mail autoresponder, look at the example in qmail/mailgate/home/aldigit/.qmail-holiday 
and set up a text file with the outgoing message. this needs to be in the form of an email - i.e. complete
with headers. e.g.

  From: Dominic Hawken <dominic@aldigital.co.uk>
  Subject: I am on holiday
  Precedence: bulk

  I will be away from the office until September 7th.

  If you are emailing regarding AL Digital, Volume, Federation or Digital
  Tables and require an immediate response, please call the office on +44
  (20) 8742 0755, or email Alison at alison@aldigital.co.uk.

  Cheers,
  Dominic.

make a sub directory in /var/tmp that corresponds to last argument in the .qmail file - e.g., in this case, 
/var/tmp/dominic. make sure that the directory is owned by the domain that receives the mail for that
user - in this case "aldigital".

create a .qmail file for the user (.qmail-dominic) in the home directory for the mail domain (aldigital):

  dominic@male.aldigital.co.uk
  |qmail-autoresponder -t 460800 /var/tmp/domhols.txt /var/tmp/dominic

send him a mail from your pc to test that you get the message.

to switch off the service, simply delete the .qmail-<user> file. (unless it's fowarding to somewhere other than our
default (male), in which case delete the qmail-autoresponder line instead).
