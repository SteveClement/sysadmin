Brightness of the screen

The Vaio has an excellent screen, also usable outdoors. However, indoors its
brightness is rather high. In order to dim the screen, I first did the
following:

1. modprobe sonypi
2. add a line with 'sonypi' in /etc/modules
3. apt-get install spicctrl
4. Enter 'spicctrl' to see the options

However, the brightness of the screen could not be modified with this
software. The solution, which worked, was as follows:

1.  Download the driver sony_acpi, available on http://popies.net/sonypi/
    on a link at the bottom of the web-page
2.  Download sony_acpi.tar.gz
3.  gunzip sony_acpi.tar.gz
4.  tar xvf sony_acpi.tar
5.  cd sony_acpi
6.  make (ignore the warning messages)
7.  as root do: cp sony_acpi.ko /lib/modules/2.6.11-1-686/kernel/drivers/acpi/
    (where you have to use your kernel-version, if yours is not 2.6.11-1-686)
8.  depmod -a
9.  modprobe sony_acpi
10. Now you find an entry in /proc:  /proc/acpi/sony/brt
11. The value of /proc/acpi/sony/brt may be between 1 (relatively dark) and 8
(bright)
12. The brightness of the screen may now be dimmed a bit with the command:
    echo "4" > /proc/acpi/sony/brt
13. My thanks to Stelian Pop, who wrote this driver!
