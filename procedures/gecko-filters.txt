This is a guid to locate and manually edit the Message filters of Mozila Like Mail clients.

Locate you profile directory in your home dir, to give you an approximate idea mine is:

/Users/steve/Library/Thunderbird/Profiles/default/yvgtmnc9.slt/ImapMail/imap.ion.lu

the Imap stuff is my MAIN mail server (incoming) adapt the directory to your setup.

In that directory there should be a file called msgFilterRules.dat or similar it looks like this:

version="8"
logging="no"
name="Virus Filter"
enabled="yes"
type="1"
action="Move to folder"
actionValue="imap://steve@imap.ion.lu/INBOX/Qmail-scanned"
condition="OR (subject,contains,Disallowed Attachment)"


For the spam filters Mozilla creates a BINARY file called training.dat so no joy here....
BREAKING 3months old news: http://bayesjunktool.mozdev.org/index.html

so we can take a look into da training.dat file...

Regular filters take precedence over spam filters, but as soon as you access a mail folder where theres filtered mail the Spam Filtering takes place
