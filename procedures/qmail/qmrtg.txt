2) to enable qmrtg monitoring:
a) have a look at the ${PREFIX}/www/data/cfg/mrtg.cfg" file.
you must at least set the 'WorkDir:' variable and qmail log paths
(search for '/var/log/supervise/qmail' and adapt to your system)
b) configure qmrtg.conf. Defaults are fine generally. At least copy
${PREFIX}/qmrtg.conf.sample to "qmrtg.conf".
c) make mrtg run automatically. Using cron, put that in "/etc/crontab": 

*/5 * * * *   root /usr/local/bin/mrtg \
         /usr/local/www/data/qmrtg/cfg/mrtg.cfg 1>/dev/null 2>&1

	 Note: to skip qmrtg reporting your mx' whole history at the first
	 call,
	 run the following before "c)"
	 $ qmrtgsync.sh



QMRTG has been installed.
Generation 2 is no longer compatible with older releases (< 2.0) !!!

There's still some steps you may need to do manually:
1) QMRTG SETUP. If you're coming from older versions, re-adjust the
configuration file (start from the .dist one)
2) WWW SETUP. HTML templates are now installed as shared data
[ share/qmrtg ]. Copying them in some http-reachable dir is your
job by now. This is cleaner and less intrusive.
3) MRTG SETUP. Possibly adjust the mrtg.cfg example provided in examples.
You may need to set the path of qmail' queue if non-standard.
4) RUN. The file RUNNING.txt in the shared doc dir tells you how

Replace
1)  "root" with the name of the user you run qmrtg as
2)  "/var/www/stats/mrtg-qmrtg/cfg/mrtg.cfg" with the path of the
MRTG (!, not qmrtg) configuration file you just set up.
